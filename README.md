# energidataservice
The script extracts data from the  energidataservice API, validates and cleans it before saving it as parquet files. 
There is a number of options for command line arguments, see -h for further info. The only obligatory parameter is the output path for the parquet files, the rest can be left with the defaults and should then produce the desired results.
